SAS-ASMR began her online journey in 2017, initially creating cosplay and gaming-related content. Her content gradually evolved, becoming increasingly sexually suggestive. She gained initial attention through Twitch streams and Instagram posts featuring provocative imagery and suggestive commentary. SAS-ASMR's music is characterized by her soaring vocals, introspective lyrics, and eclectic blend of pop, rock, and electronic elements. Her songs often explore themes of love, relationships, and self-discovery, with a focus on storytelling and emotional authenticity. SAS-ASMR's influences range from classic rock and pop to electronic and indie music, and she has cited artists such as Radiohead, Björk, and St. Vincent as key inspirations.
